We would like to welcome all of you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are parents like you, blessed with four children - our first two entering the teen years - yikes!</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"article-title\">Background</h4>\r\n</article>\r\n</article>\r\n\r\n<p>Our love for producing media for Muslim children started roughly in 2007. Both myself and my wife, who most often is in the drivers seat, are converts to Islam. Al&#39;hamdulillah we are no longer children in the religion - more like cranky teenagers. Over the last two&nbsp;dacades as Muslims we realized there was very little in the way of children&#39;s media refelcting our values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we dedicated ourselves to giving back to the community with the talents Allah SWT has provided us.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<article class=\"featured-article\">\r\n<h4 class=\"article-title\">Purpose</h4>\r\n</article>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope that this site will give children, like our own, a place to express themselves and to define themselves as the youngest members of the Muslim community. We hope that the site will be a platform for them get to know their young&nbsp;brothers and sisters around the world.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only thing we ask of you as parents is to spend some time with your children on this site. It is built to be highly interactive and&nbsp;offers many different ways for your children to express themselves online. Please take some time to work with your children on some of the projects and activities on the site and do encourage them to share what they do one the site. We hope that after you introduce them to what is possible on the site then they will run with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We would love to hear from you. What you are liking?&nbsp;What can we do better? And what content you would like to see on the site?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks for giving the site a try.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Michael Milo</p>\r\n",

There is a lack of resources that reflect our children&#39;s identities, that are engaging and of high quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also know that there is a high demand from Home School parents for interesting and challenging online materials that reflect Muslim values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sadly, Muslim children are sometimes a neglected and forgotten segment of our community when it comes to educational resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We ask Allah SWT that this site becomes a starting point for the development of the next generation of Islamic educational materials - materials that reflect the realities of Muslim children living in the 21 Century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is an incredibly different world for our children from the realities we as adults knew - in a time before computers!&nbsp; So many children are so immersed in a mediated environment - computers, television and computer games.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is our belief that our children will appreciate educational materials that reflect that reality. We hope that Muslim Kids TV - our website and supporting educational resources - will fulfill this need, InshaAllah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a parent or educator, what do you think? Is it time to have more multimedia resources for our Muslim children?</p>\r\n</article>\r\n",

These personal stories alone can provide great conversation and lessons for kids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are a few other suggestions for topics that are rich in meaning and life lessons for children.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Explain how Prophet Abraheem &ndash; peace be upon him, built the Kabah</li>\r\n\t<li>Inquire how Hajar demonstrated profound faith and trust in Allah and the depth of mothers love for her children. How is this renacted by performing Sa&rsquo;i?</li>\r\n\t<li>What parenting lessons can be taken from how Prophet Ismail &ndash; peace be upon him, was an obedient son and willing to listen to Allah SWT at all cost?</li>\r\n\t<li>How did the Prophet Muhammed &ndash; peace be upon him, and his companions struggle to perform Hajj?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Hajj is one of the more detailed and intricate of all rites in Islam. One way to teach your children about the day to day activities during Hajj is to watch the Muslim Kids TV series <strong>Hajj: An Easy to Follow Guide</strong>.

You can even upload your own content and share it with others... </span></h4>\r\n\r\n<h4><span style=\"color:#808080;\">On the top of that, you&rsquo;ll find a lot of creative ideas that you can do with your kids at home. I definitely recommend this site for homeschooling parents and also Muslim parents in general.&quot;</span></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Muslim Kids TV was developed with the needs of parents in mind. We thought a lot about how home school parents provide interactive educational experiences for their children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the site The Create and Share page allows children to participate in off-line projects and then upload them to the site. Children are challenged with everything from learning the meaning of their name to interviewing their local Imam to find out what it takes to become a religious scholar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Muslim Kids TV cares deeply about the development of our future generation. They need to be protected and nurtured and as Rahmah Muslim Homeschool states:</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><span style=\"color:#808080;\">&quot;The good thing about MKTV is there are no inappropriate ads and no un-Islamic suggested videos like on Youtube.</span>&quot;</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.rahmahmuslimhomeschool.co.uk/index/review-muslim-kids-tv-25-off-coupon-code/\" target=\"_blank\">You can read the full text of the article here.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have any ideas of how to make Muslim Kids TV an even better experience for home schoolers, we&#39;d love to hear from you.</p>\r\n",

    "text": "<h2>Creativity is an essential part of the healthy development of children.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Fostering a creative mind allows us to see the world from many angles; solve problems through multiple unique solutions; and generally live a productive and fulfilled life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Children should be given every opportunity to test their own creativity. Art has always been one area where children can do this and explore various ways to solve a problem. The skills learned through a good artistic challenge will be training children to use this creative thinking in other aspects of life. This creative problem solving can be applied to scientific research, engineering and medicine. It can also be applied to any aspect of life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sakinah Circle is a full time program that is part of the Edmonton Public School system in Canada. It has an excellent art program. The challenges stretch students&#39; imaginations as well as their technical skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some examples of the excellent work.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Starry Nights</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This project examines the artwork of the famous 20th century painter Vincent VanGogh. Known for the poetic rendering of the visual world, students were asked to also think of the art as not simply representing a factual depiction of the visual space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/media/public/media/ckeditor/2014/12/09/starry-nights1_1.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 375px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Nourishing our Hearts</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;The heart is the centre of our feelings and emotions. So what better theme for students to explore in an excersie on the expressive potential of repeatative pattern, shapes and color.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/media/public/media/ckeditor/2014/12/09/nourishing-hearts1_1.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 375px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Stepping Outside the Box</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are no prohibitions in Islam about being creative or celebrating the beautiful. So why not push the limits of your own creativity or the art program in your school?

    "text": "<article class=\"featured-article\">\r\n<h4 class=\"article-title\">Al Hijra Islamic School in Winnipeg, Canada is one of the Muslim Kids TV educational partners.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Al Hijra was founded in 1996 and has 240 students from Kindergarten to grade 9 program. The school offers its program in cooperation with the Manitoba Ministry of Education and provides children an accredited education with an Islamic focus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/media/public/media/ckeditor/2015/04/08/alhijra.JPG\" style=\"width: 306px; height: 230px; float: left; margin: 25px; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On special thing about Al Hijra is that it is a UNESCO school. UNESCO is the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. It is a special agency of the United Nation whose purpose is to contribute to peace and security by promoting international collaboration through education, science, and culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Al hijra school UNESCO\" src=\"/media/public/media/ckeditor/2015/04/08/unesco-logo.jpg\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 320px; float: right; margin: 25px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Al Hijra has developed a learning partnership with 5 other schools in Winnipeg. They have all been designated as UNESCO schools. These unique schools extend their learning across their school boundaries into wider Winnipeg and to a global community. The schools cooperate to engage students in an interfaith dialogue and intercultural learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UNESCO schools have developed a Cultural Diversity Program. It is designed to recognize and give significance to the students&#39; personal and cultural identities while encouraging knowledge, understanding, appreciation and respect of other people&#39;s religions and cultures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each June grade 5 students from the 5 schools participate in an interactive workshop learning about diversity. These workshops continue for two years and in the second year the students visit a Mosque, Church and Synagogue where they dialogue with the clerics in each of the houses of Worship. Classroom discussions and exposure to cultural diversity literature throughout the school year provide continued learning experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/media/public/media/ckeditor/2015/04/08/alhijra-kids.jpg\" style=\"width: 240px; height: 180px; margin: 25px; float: left;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most exciting aspect of the UNESCO schools is student representatives from each school come together to collaboratively develop action plans related to social justice and environmental sustainable initiatives. This collaboration gives the students at Al Hijra Islamic School exposure to real world challenges and build in them the skills to be ambassadors of Islam to the broader world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</article>\r\n",

Sometimes, students need a positive nudge in the right direction. What&rsquo;s more encouraging than boasting some brownies? Tell your students that each time the entire class turns in their home work; you will color in a block on a bar graph that you have made. You can start out small, and create a bar that has ten blocks inside of it to be colored (then, gradually make your bar taller by adding more blocks, hence making it more of a challenge to get the entire thing colored in). Once all blocks are colored inside the bar, reward your students with a brownie. It&rsquo;s a great way to ensure all homework gets turned in, it teaches students about setting goals, as well as accountability; and it requires total team work!</p>\r\n</article>\r\n",

You don&rsquo;t want to seat students just anywhere. When creating a seating chart, be sure to have a pencil, a map of your classroom drawn out, and a class list in front of you. One major thing to consider when grouping students is ability level. If you have 24 students in your classroom, consider arranging desks into three equal groups. Within these groups, have at least two above grade level students, three on-level grade students, and 3 below level students. This scaffolding effect will encourage higher level thinking from all students and will motivate and allow your lower level students to take cues from higher level students who can model certain thinking strategies, demonstrate what high quality work looks like, and can help expose the rest of the group to a more expansive vocabulary.</p>\r\n</article>\r\n",

No one wants to be picked last, left out, or work with the same student over and over again. To avoid partner boredom and potential behavioral problems in the classroom, pick perfect partners every time by making partner cards. Find images of objects that go together naturally, like peanut butter and jelly, Charlie Brown and Snoopy, or a sock and a shoe. Make enough of these pairs so that there is enough for each student to have one card. Be sure to cut these objects out and laminate them. Give each student one card and tell them to find their match. Once they have done so, they return the cards to you and can get started on their collaborative activity, stress-free!</p>\r\n",

So, help them develop their organizational skills by stuffing handy helpers with everything your students need and place them in the center of each group. Handy helpers can be containers that have segmented compartments that can hold glue sticks, scissors, and packs of crayons, colored pencils, markers, tape, (etc.) in each section. Students can easily access these items and will always have them handy. They will not have to empty their desk to search for them and hold up the rest of the class when you wish to move on with your lesson. The containers can be purchased for a small price in bulk, or you can make your own using an old shoe box!</p>\r\n</article>\r\n</article>\r\n",

So, help them out! Set up a student station in your room. A great place to do this is right next to your pencil sharpener. Place a basket by it containing everything your students need-pencils, erasers, white out, paper clips, tape, a stapler (etc.). This way they can have what they need all in one place and they do not have to interrupt you to ask for a supply. It encourages them to be prepared for class and to help themselves when they need to.</p>\r\n</article>\r\n",

You can even include some skill worksheets and websites to visit to reinforce a concept.

They may not know how to pronounce certain words, what the words mean, or they may finish a chapter or several paragraphs and may not know what they just read. When students are reading on their own, give them a card that has a red light on one side, and a green light on the other. As you circulate around the room, you can stop and assist a struggling student with one of these independent aspects of reading when they put the red light side on their desk. If students are reading fluently and comprehending what they are reading, they can keep the green light side up to silently signal to you that they don&rsquo;t need any help!</p>\r\n",

Help students with this transition by modeling certain behaviors. Actually walk them through the process of how they should line up at a classroom door and how they should hold their books and belongings (large items on bottom, small items on top) so they don&rsquo;t drop them on their hallway transition. You can also teach them to prepare for class by sharpening not one, not two, but three or four pencils so they won&rsquo;t have to get up during instruction to sharpen any. It&rsquo;s the small stuff that counts and that a teacher often looks over because they assume their students know how to do these little things, but sometimes it&rsquo;s the little things that can make all the difference.</p>\r\n",

    "text": "<h2 class=\"article-title\">Teaching Tips: Quality of Work</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Student work is often ranked on a rating scale. Four is usually the highest they can earn and one is the lowest (zero signifies that students did not do any work at all). Many students have difficulty visualizing what an example of &ldquo;4&rdquo; work looks like. So, show them! Draw a detailed picture that illustrates a short but detailed, error-free story that is written neatly. Label this a four. Recreate the same picture but with less details. Same with the story. Repeat this process until a &ldquo;1&rdquo; is a plain picture, uncolored and the story is merely a line or two. Students will be able to see the visual difference between high quality work and work that little effort is put into. Once they understand this rating scale, they can work hard to achieve a certain level that is set for them.</p>\r\n",

An important part of raising kids can be taught through healthy competition. Sports can teach children to work hard and practice to become better at something, while also showing them how to compete in a healthy way and interact with others. Moreover, sports get your child&rsquo;s heart pumping and provide a great form of exercise in a fun way. Basketball, swimming, tennis and track offer some of the best cardiovascular workouts out of all children&rsquo;s sports, but anything that gets them up and moving is beneficial.</p>\r\n\r\n<article class=\"featured-article\"><br />\r\n&nbsp;</article>\r\n",

As it was mentioned in an earlier parenting tip, simply running around the yard and playing adds physical activity for your child but there are so many ways to make your backyard more exercise friendly. A swing set, in particular, can offer great exercise for younger children. Pumping their legs on the swing, climbing up and down the slide ladder and swinging across the monkey bars are great cardiovascular movements. Adding in a trampoline, volleyball net or even a swimming pool can offer additional types of exercise from the comfort of your own yard.</p>\r\n",

    "text": "<h2 class=\"article-title\">Kids Healthy Living: Ride a Bike</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only does driving a car omit damaging fumes for the environment but it also provides absolutely no physical activity. Riding a bike on the other hand causes absolutely no harm to the environment and packs a great work out at the same time. If your child has a bike, encourage them to ride a bike whenever possible instead of having you drop them off. One of scariest times when raising kids is deciding when your child is old enough to go off on their own so make sure that you feel they are ready before trying this parenting tip. In the alternative, you can ride your bike along with them until they are ready to ride on their own.</p>\r\n",

Excess sugar can negatively impact your child&rsquo;s health by contributing to obesity, tooth decay and nutritional deficiencies. In addition, it can also cause behavioral problems such as mood swings, lack of focus and bouts of hyperactivity. Since soda has absolutely no nutritional value, it has no place in anyone&rsquo;s diet &ndash; regardless of age. One of the best parenting tips for your child&rsquo;s nutritional needs is to ban soda from the home and choose only natural fruit juices, milk and water.</p>\r\n",

Raising kids to reach for a glass of water instead of any other beverage is the best way to ensure they are drinking enough water. If you follow parenting tip number 1 above, then choosing water should be an easy choice. Don&rsquo;t forget to offer more water when your child is playing or expending extra energy.</p>\r\n",

You may think you are doing the right thing by forcing your child to eat their food but you can actually be doing more harm. If your child refuses to eat the spinach on their plate then don&rsquo;t force them. This will only instill their dislike of the vegetable and may cause them to become even pickier. Instead, find another healthy option to replace it. Offer up another vegetable that you know they like and they will still reap the health benefits.</p>\r\n</article>\r\n",

The issues facing Muslim families around the world are very similar. Families everywhere have expressed the need to support their children with the highest quality content that reflects Muslim beliefs and values.

    "text": "<h4 class=\"article-title\">The Philippines - a nation in transition</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The country is shared by Christians and Muslims. Islam was the first monotheistic religion in the Philippines with early historical records showing contact between the island population and Muslims traders from Arabian, Persian, Chinese and other Malay lands as early as the 14th century. Today Muslims make up about 12% of the population with a growing number of Filipino Muslim converts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the southern Muslim region in the Philippines is under-developed, there is renewed emphasis by the government to focus development in Muslim regions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Muslim Kids TV founders held a series of meetings in the Philippines to explore ways Muslim Kids TV may be integrated into development work and the education system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Muslim Kids TV met with representatives from the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos. NCMF advocates for the rights of the Muslim Filipinos and reports directly to the Office of the President of the Philippines. A meeting was also held with Director General Jose Mari Oquinena of the Philippines Information Agency to discuss ways MKTV may be used to increase understanding among all children about Muslim faith and values. The Director General commented that, &quot;Muslim Kids TV is an excellent initative and I see it as a way to bring the world to the Muslim children in the Philippines. It is also a great way to bring all our young brothers and sister from all faiths together as one country.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"National Commission on Muslim Filipinos\" src=\"/media/public/media/ckeditor/2016/05/21/mktv-meeting-w-ncmf.jpg\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 334px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Meeting with National Commission on Muslim Filipinos</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Meetings were also held with representatives from the Department of Education from Manila and the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao. Muslim Kids TV will be an excellent fit as part of the Arabic Language Islamic Values Education (ALIVE) curriculum in the Philippines.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/media/public/media/ckeditor/2016/05/21/mktv-meeting-w-national-council-for-childrens-television.jpg\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 488px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Meeting with National Council for Children&#39;s Television.</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many efforts underway to improve the educational opportunities for Muslims in the Philippines also being carried out by NGOs like UNICEF and Asia Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We look forward to working together with some of these partners in bringing Muslim Kids TV to the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A special thanks to the Canadian Trade Commission in Manila for facilitating these meetings for Muslim Kids TV.</p>\r\n",
